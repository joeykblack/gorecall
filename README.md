# GoRecall

https://joeykblack.github.io/gorecall/

This app displays a sequence from an SGF file and tests the uers on their ability to recall it.

I do not know how valuable this method of study is or if this app implements it well. You are probably better off doing tsumego.

TODO
- install as app on phone
- Fix result when sequence is shorter than selected number.
- Cleanup UI
- Joseki file with only good variations or a way to filter out bad variations 

Frameworks: Vite + PReact (JavaScript)

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Scripts:
- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — build production file (single index.html in the docs folder for github.io)
- `npm run preview` — locally preview the production build
